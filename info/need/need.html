            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's world, where technology connects us more than ever, cybersecurity has become essential. Our daily lives are increasingly digital, with everything from banking to personal communication happening online. While this connectivity offers many benefits, it also brings significant risks, as cyber threats are on the rise. For individuals, businesses, and governments alike, cybersecurity is not just an option; it is a necessity to protect sensitive information and ensure safety in our digital interactions.</p>

            <h2>Cyber Threats</h2>
            <p>The growth of connected devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has expanded the opportunities for cybercriminals. According to a report from the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), cyberattacks have increased in frequency and complexity. These attacks range from stealing personal data to ransomware attacks that can disrupt business operations. Such incidents lead to significant economic losses and can compromise the privacy and security of millions of people.</p>

            <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity affects not only information safety but also has a direct impact on the global economy. Companies that experience cyberattacks may face high costs related to data recovery, system repairs, and loss of customer trust. A study by Cybersecurity Ventures estimates that global cybercrime costs will reach six trillion dollars annually. This figure highlights the urgency of investing in effective cybersecurity measures to protect organizations and consumers alike.</p>

        <section class="section" id="data-protection">
            <h2>Data Protection</h2>
            <p>In the digital age, personal data is one of the most valuable assets. The collection and storage of data by companies and digital platforms have raised concerns about privacy and security. Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe emphasize the importance of protecting personal information. Cybersecurity thus becomes a fundamental pillar to ensure that user data is safeguarded against unauthorized access and misuse.</p>

        <section class="section" id="responsibility">
            <h2>Shared Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is not solely the responsibility of IT professionals or security departments in companies. Every individual has a role to play in creating a secure digital environment. Education and awareness about safe online practices, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and identifying phishing emails, are essential to strengthen collective cyber defense. Additionally, companies should promote a culture of security, where all employees understand the importance of protecting information and follow security protocols.</p>
